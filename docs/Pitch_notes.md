[0:00 – 0:20] The problem

"Every company right now is trying to deploy AI agents — and most of them are hitting the same wall. Not because the models aren't good enough, but because the data underneath is chaos. Emails, spreadsheets, accounting software, Google Drive — everything scattered, nothing structured. And when an agent lands in that environment, it has no context, no memory, nowhere to navigate. 
This is Folio, we build the second-brain that makes companies AI-ready.

"To get started, We connect to the firm's existing tools — Gmail, Drive, Excel, and soon many others —  the first thing we do is make the chaos visible. emails,  accounting entries,  documents, all indexed in seconds using Gemini's multimodal processing.
Then Claude agents classify, cross-reference, and build a hierarchical knowledge graph in real time — watch it form on screen. Finance, Compliance, Clients, each period, each document finding its place. The graph is live in Convex, so every write hits the UI instantly. 
Folio optimises its agents by keeping an internal forum: broadcasting when one discovers a more efficient way of processing data, continuously evolving agent`s skills.
And along the way the agents surface what a human would miss — the same revenue figure in two documents with two different amounts, a VAT filing referencing invoices that haven't been created yet."


[1:05 – 1:25] The opportunity

That's where we started. We looked at French accounting firms — 19,000 cabinets, 3 million SME clients behind them, a profession under real AI pressure — and we saw exactly this problem at scale. So we built the layer underneath. This is Folio."


[1:25 – 1:38] Human in the loop

"Before the knowledge base goes live, we don't just hand it over. We run a verification pass — a focused questionnaire. Is this column a client code or an invoice reference? Which revenue figure is authoritative? Ten minutes of human attention, and the foundation is solid. Verified, paradox-free, navigable with clear data visualisation."

"And then it stays alive. New email, new contract, new Pennylane entry — Folio classifies it, places it, flags anything that contradicts what's already verified. The knowledge base updates itself day after day. Every agent you build on top of it tomorrow starts with full context."

"19,000 firms, 3 million clients — and the same problem in every industry. We built the infrastructure layer that makes companies agent-ready. This is Folio."
